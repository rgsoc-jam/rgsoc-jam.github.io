## Things we did:
- Request API
    - Turns out there is a Request struct already written in Servo. But the names it uses are different from what the codegen generates from the webidl. So I have to write `Into` implementation to allow translation between the two.
    - Completed writing `Into` implementation.

- Headers API
    - Worked on filling in the constructor for the Headers API, following [the spec](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-headers-fill).

## Things we learned:
- [`Into`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.Into.html) allows Rust to "translate" between two different objects.

## TODO:
- Headers:
    - constructor
    - introspective methods, such as `get` and `has`
- Request:
    - readonly attributes should be re-implemented
    - continue writing constructor
