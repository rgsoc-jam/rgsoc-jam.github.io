## Things we did:
- Headers API
    - Submitted [PR#3](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/12634) for review.
    - Addressed some of the feedback.
- Studied some basic Rust concepts which have been tripping us up
- Jeena:
    - Attended Edward Tufteâ€™s course on presenting data and information
    - Will be making up the hours this weekend

## Things we learned:
- Use Servo's convenient `dom::bindings::error::{Error, ErrorResult, Fallible}` when needed
- More about Strings and references
- The following does the same thing, but the second one is shorter:

{% highlight rust %}
match self.header_list.borrow_mut().get_raw(&valid_name) {
    Some(v) => Ok(Some(ByteString::new(v[0].clone()))),
    None => Ok(None),
}
{% endhighlight %}
The following code takes advantage of [`map` for `Option` types](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/src/core/up/src/libcore/option.rs.html#369-389).
{% highlight rust %}
Ok(self.header_list.borrow().get_raw(&valid_name).map(|v| {
    ByteString::new(v[0].clone())
}))
{% endhighlight %}

## TODO:
- Headers:
    - File an issue against Fetch specification for special case where `set-cookie` is the header name.
- Response:
    - If Headers is accepted, start working on Response.
- Request:
    - Continue with constructor!
