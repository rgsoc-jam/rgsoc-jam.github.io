## Things we did:
- Response
    - Finally submitted [PR](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/13058). Fixed up the code based on feedback I got back.
- Fetch
    - I wrote the algorithm to send the fetch message to the resource thread (`net_traits`).
    - It looks like the parts I can do right now are mostly done, but it needs double checking!

## Things we learned:
- Stefan showed us some examples of asynchronous code written in [AngularJS](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$q) and also CoffeeScript, as an introduction to Promises.
- [Closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures#Closure)! We went to Portland's Papers We Love meetup yesterday and learned about Garbage Collectors. It seems like with JS closures, sometimes you might have to move stack-created objects to the heap. Interesting!

## TODO:
- Promise in Fetch
    - implement the Promise return value for `fetch()` on top of jdm's branch
- Test Curation
    - curate the failing tests and opening an issue for each category so that others can pick up where we left if we don't finish implementing fetch, i.e. tests that fail because of Promise, because of OpenDictionary, etc.
- Body (Malisa)
    - Start implementing Body for Request and Response
- Miscellaneous
    - Publish a blog post about move, clone, and copy! (Jeena)
    - Set up blog and write about deref coercion, etc (Malisa)
