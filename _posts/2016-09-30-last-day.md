Today is the last day of RGSoC. We are incredibly sad, and proud of our summer!

## Things we did:
- Both of us worked on a secret blog post. It will be ready soon!

## Things we learned:
A couple failing tests and their reasons:
{% highlight console %}
assert_equals: response type is basic expected "basic" but got "default"
{% endhighlight %}
- our API for returning responses (ie. process_response) doesn't differentiate between the different types yet, so we need to make that possible to make those tests pass. Josh thinks that `FetchMetadata` will need to be changed.

{% highlight console %}
assert_equals: Content-Type is text/html; charset=utf-8 expected "text/html;charset=utf-8" but got "text/html; charset=utf-8"
{% endhighlight %}
There's a lot of [debate](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/pull/2807) what to do with a space.

## TODO:
- Keep learning.
- Improve Fetch so that it passes more tests!
