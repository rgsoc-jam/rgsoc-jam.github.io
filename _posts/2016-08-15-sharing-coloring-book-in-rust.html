<p>This is a cross post from <a href="http://jeenalee.com">Jeena's blog</a>.</p>

<p>
  My friend <a href="https://github.com/malisas">Malisa</a> and I have
  been hacking on Servo this summer. We started from scratch, with no
  experience writing Rust, let alone compiled langauges. It's
  been challenging and fun! One of the trickier Rust concepts to
  understand for me was Rust's references and
  borrowing.
</p>

<p>
Ownership in Rust is in many ways like owning a coloring book. You can
have all your friends come look at it together and flip through the
pages. However, they can't color in it. This is an <i>immutable borrow</i> in
Rust lingo.
</p>

<p>But say you actually want to create a collective art piece with the
coloring book. You can lend it to one friend at a time and tell them
they can color however they want, or <i>mutably borrow</i> in Rust
lingo. They have to give the book back to you when they're done, and
you may lend it to the next friend, and so on<a href="#ref_0"><sup>0</sup></a>. If you tried to let
two friends color at the same time, they can end up fighting to color
the same spot.
</p>

<p> These are the two rules of Rust's borrow system:
  <ol>
    <li>If it's mutably borrowed, it must be the only borrow that currently exists.</li>
    <li>Otherwise, many friends can borrow immutably at the same time.</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>In both cases, if the lender wants to color the book, then they
must get it back from the borrowers first. How else would you color a
book you don't have in your hands?!</p>

<p>I've found that making the compilation fail, and then reading the
compiler's detailed messages is a great way to learn these new
concepts. <a href="http://words.steveklabnik.com/">Steve Klabnik</a>,
the author of "The Book", wrote an
awesome <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/references-and-borrowing.html">introduction</a>
to Rust's borrow system, so let's mess
with <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/references-and-borrowing.html#mut-references">one
    of its examples</a>, break things, and learn!
</p>

<p> Let's start with something simple that compiles:</p>

{% highlight rust %}
fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;
    let mut y = x;

    y += 1;

    println!("x is: {}", x);
    println!("y is: {}", y);
}
{% endhighlight %}
<a href="https://is.gd/YCkc7h">Link to code</a>, and its compilation message:
{% highlight bash %}
warning: variable does not need to be mutable, #[warn(unused_mut)] on by default
 --> <anon>:2:9
2 |>     let mut x = 5;
  |>         ^^^^^

x is: 5
y is: 6
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
The compiler helpfully warns that <code>x</code> didn't have to be
mutable. But why? It's because <code>y</code> ends up being a separate
copy of <code>5</code>, and <code>x</code> is never modified in the
code. You can tell that <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are two
different things in the memory, because the printed values are
different.
</p>

<p>What if we didn't want to copy <code>x</code> into <code>y</code>,
and wanted changes to <code>y</code> to apply to <code>x</code>?</p>

{% highlight rust %}
fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;
    let mut y = &x;

    *y += 1;

    println!("y is: {}", y);
}
{% endhighlight %}
<a href="https://is.gd/0sC8kK">Link to code</a>, and its compilation message:
{% highlight bash %}
error: cannot assign to immutable borrowed content `*y`
 --> <anon>:5:5
5 |>     *y += 1;
  |>     ^^^^^^^

error: aborting due to previous error
{% endhighlight %}

<p> What happened? This time, <code>y</code> is not a copy
of <code>x</code>. Instead, <code>y</code> is a <i>reference</i>
to <code>x</code>, and therefore, it had to be <i>dereferenced</i>
before 1 is added to <code>y</code>. One important thing to note is
that <code>y</code> is an <b>immutable</b> reference, even
though <code>y</code> itself is mutable! That is why the compilation
fails. <code>y</code> didn't have the permission to change the value,
  yet it tried to do so anyways.</p>

<p>
Now that we know what's going on, let's fix this code and make
the compiler happy again!</p>

{% highlight rust %}
fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;
    let mut y = &mut x;

    *y += 1;

    println!("y is: {}", y);
}
{% endhighlight %}
<a href="https://is.gd/o1nKt9">Link to code</a>, and its output:
{% highlight bash %}
y is: 6
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
<code>y</code> takes a mutable borrow of <code>x</code>, and it
can change <code>x</code>'s value. So when we print <code>y</code> it
successfully prints 6.
</p>
<p>What happens if we try to print <code>x</code> instead? This
brings us
to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/references-and-borrowing.html#thinking-in-scopes">one</a>
of the Book's examples.</p>

{% highlight rust %}
fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;
    let mut y = &mut x;

    *y += 1;

    println!("x is: {}", x);
}
{% endhighlight %}
<a href="https://is.gd/ZYdXsQ">Link to code</a>, and its compilation message:
{% highlight bash %}
error: cannot borrow `x` as immutable because it is also borrowed as mutable [--explain E0502]

{% endhighlight %}

<p>Compilation
fails! The compiler gives a pretty good explanation. It says that
<code>println!</code> cannot immutably borrow <code>x</code>
because <code>x</code> is already mutably borrowed
by <code>y</code>. This violates the first rule of Rust's borrow
system: when something is mutably borrowed, there cannot be other
borrows.
</p>
<p>The Book
shows <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/references-and-borrowing.html#mut-references">a
way</a> to correct this code by using curly brackets to introduce a
  nested scope.
</p>

{% highlight rust %}
fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;
    {
        let y = &mut x;
        *y += 1;
    }
    println!("x is: {}", x);
}
{% endhighlight %}
<a href="https://is.gd/4Razar">Link to code</a>, and its output:
{% highlight bash %}
x is: 6
{% endhighlight %}

<p> The Book does a
better job in explaining scopes than I can, so I highly recommend
reading <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/references-and-borrowing.html#thinking-in-scopes">the
    Book</a> about this section.
</p>
<p>
Let's break this code one last time.</p>

{% highlight rust %}
fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;
    {
        let y = &mut x;
        *y += 1;
    }
    println!("y is: {}", y);
}
{% endhighlight %}
<a href="https://is.gd/BffVNx">Link to code</a>, and its compilation message:
{% highlight bash %}
error: unresolved name `y`. Did you mean `x`? [--explain E0425]
 --> <anon>:7:26
7 |>     println!("y is: {}", y);
  |>                          ^

<anon>:7:5: 7:29: note: in this expansion of println! (defined in <std macros>)

{% endhighlight %}

<p>The compiler lets us know that <code>y</code> does not exist. This is
because <code>y</code> is defined inside the inner scope delineated by the pair of curly brackets, and outside
of them, <code>y</code> doesn't exist! Introducing inner scopes gets very handy
when you want to define things only temporarily.</p>

<p>
The Rust compiler does a great job of pointing out possible sources of
error in the code. Compilation errors are not scary, and they're in
fact a great conversation starter with the compiler. Try introducing
different kinds of errors, and see how the compiler responds. From
these conversations, I find myself learning new concepts that I didn't
know before, and writing better code over time.
</p>

<p>Now you should go break some code! Thanks for reading!</p>
