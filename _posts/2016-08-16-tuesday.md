## Things we did:
- Headers Iterable
    - Wrote a rough version of iterable implementaton. Additional tests pass.
    - Started implementing [parse](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#cors-safelisted-request-header) for `content-type` header name
- Response API
    - Got completely confused about what I'm supposed to do next. Gave up trying to reconcile the spec, the multiple `hyper::header::Headers` objects, and the nuances of implementing for Servo (for now).
    - Focusing on just writing the Response API as though I only have one version of `hyper::header::Headers` in dom::Headers...

## Things we learned:
- [Threads](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/) vs processes (thanks [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing))!): In the operating system, two "processes" do not share memory. A process can contain multiple "threads" which share memory and other resources.
    - This is rather relevant to the whole multiple-references-to-the-same-object problem. You need to be aware of whether the references exist in different processes (if so, you can't use the `Rc` or `Arc` types, which are for sharing within a process).

## TODO:
- Response API:
    - Work on the constructor while figuring out what to do next
- Headers Iterable
    - Continue implementing parse
    - Refactor iterable implementation
