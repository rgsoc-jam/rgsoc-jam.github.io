Hello World!

Tomorrow, our summer begins. We will hack on [Servo](https://github.com/servo/servo/), a web browser engine built with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org). Our goal of the summer is to implement the JS [Fetch API](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#fetch-api) in Servo. We are blessed to have support from our wonderful coaches ([Morgan](https://twitter.com/mrrrgn), [Nick](https://twitter.com/fitzgen), and [Stefan](https://twitter.com/datahipster)), mentor ([Josh](https://twitter.com/lastontheboat)), supervisor ([Scott](https://twitter.com/ScottKbka)), and of course [Rails Girls Summer of Code](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/)! Many many thanks to everyone.

Tonight, we learned about the big picture of the Fetch API.
