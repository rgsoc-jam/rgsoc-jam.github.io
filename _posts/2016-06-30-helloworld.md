Hello World!

Tomorrow, our summer begins. We will hack on [Servo] (https://github.com/servo/servo/), a web browser engine built with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org). Our goal of the summer is to implement JS [Fetch API](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#fetch-api) in Servo. We are blessed to have support from our wonderful coaches ([Morgan](), [Nick](), and [Stefan]()), mentor ([Josh]()), supervisor ([Scott]()), and of course [Rails Girls Summer of Code](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/)! Many many thanks to everyone.

Tonight, we learned about the big picture of the Fetch API.
