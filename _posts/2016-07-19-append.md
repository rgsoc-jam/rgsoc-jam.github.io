## Things we did:
- Addressed the feedback that we missed yesterday, and new feedback we received today.
- We got an approval from Josh! Woohoo!
- Started working on our next goals. Malisa will continue working on headers, and Jeena will start working on request.

## Things we learned:
- `git rebase -i <remote>/<branch>` allows you to squash the commits between the current HEAD and the HEAD of `<remote>/<branch>`. If you are on local `features` branch and know that local `master` is untouched, you can `git rebase -i master`.

## TODO:
- Headers:
    - constructor
    - introspective methods, such as `get` and `has`
- Request:
    - everything!
    - think about how to implement read only attributes
