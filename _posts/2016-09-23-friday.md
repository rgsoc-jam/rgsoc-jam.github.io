## Things we did:
- Body
    - Finished refactoring (for the most part) and pushed to a [temporary branch for the Body API](https://github.com/malisas/servo/commits/malisa-bodyAPI-tmp) while Jeena adds her changes. I'll probably implement the BodyTrait for dom::request while she does that.
- Package Data Algorithm
    - Added/Refactored the package data algorithm to the temporary branch! And it compiles!

## Things we learned:
- You can directly access struct fields only if you're in the same file as the struct that you're trying to access. This at first seemed really weird and arbitrary to me, but apparently this turns out to be less of a headache (and fairly reasonable) compared to the way internal field access would be handles in C++ (according to our coach Nick). This is why it sometimes easier to implement a trait for a struct in the same file that the struct is defined (as opposed to, say, the file that the trait is defined).

## TODO:
- Body (Malisa)
    - implement the BodyTrait for dom::request. Also, rebase on top of the current master (now that promises and fetch are merged in ^^)
- Test Curation
    - Go through the new tests, and categorize them.
- Package Data Algorithm
    - Figure out how to write `FormData()` when MIMEType is "multipart/form-data"
    - Clean up the code
