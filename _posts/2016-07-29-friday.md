## Things we did:
- [Laura](https://twitter.com/alicetragedy), one of the RGSoC organizers, is in Portland for a few days, so the three of us met for coffee at one of our favorite cafes. :)
- Headers API
    - Filed [spec bug](https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/345) regarding `set-cookie` header names.
    - Updated necessary test expectations to PASS.
- Request API
    - Continued working on Constructor. Currently, up to step 15 is compiling successfully. A draft up to step 24 is written.

## Things we learned:
- There are different types of references in Rust. one of them is `&`, but you can also have "user-defined custom smart pointers" or wrappers with particular behavior for references, like [`Ref`](https://doc.servo.org/style/refcell/struct.Ref.html) and [`RefCell`](https://doc.servo.org/style/refcell/struct.RefCell.html). A helpful explanation is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/4cvc3o/what_are_cell_and_refcell_used_for/d1m2j5r) and [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/index.html).
- You can customize the type name in a use statement. For example, instead of writing `use hyper` and writing `hyper::header::Headers` throughout the code, you can use `use hyper::header::Headers as HyperHeaders` and use `HyperHeaders` in the code body.
- Air conditioning is wonderful!

## TODO:
- Response:
    - If Headers is accepted, start working on Response.
- Request:
    - Continue with constructor!
