## Things we did:
- Jeena wrote a [blog post](http://jeenalee.com/2016/08/15/sharing-coloring-books-in-rust.html) about the Rust borrow system
- Response API
    - Submitted [PR](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/12884) to wrap `hyper::header::Headers` in `Rc`. This solution may or may not work for the Response API, however, because `Rc` doesn't work across threads. Instead of manipulating the same object in multiple places, I might end up having to just work with one version of `hyper::header::Headers`, or replace `Rc` with [`Arc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html).
- Request API
    - [Request](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/12700) got merged!
    - Then someone kindly pointed out I wrote step 31 wrong, so I [fixed](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/12851) it!
    - Wrote blog post about the Rust borrow system
- Headers Iterable
    - Started looking into how to implement iterable for Headers based on jdm's branch.
    - For some reason, by allowing iterable, HeadersBinding::Wrap becomes undefined..? What??


## Things we learned:
- [Associated type](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/associated-types.html) is like a customized type for traits

## TODO:
- Response API:
    - Figure out what to do with the `Rc` PR, and then finally work on `dom::Response`
- Headers Iterable
    - Figure out what is going on!
