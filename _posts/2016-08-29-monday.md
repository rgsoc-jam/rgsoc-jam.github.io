## Things we did:
- Miscellaneous
    - Published a [blog post](http://jeenalee.com/2016/08/29/move-clone-copy.html) about computer memory, `move`, `clone`, and `copy`!
- Promise in Fetch (Jeena)
    - I rebased Fetch implementation on top of jdm's branch, and tried to use `Promise` in `fetch()`. Strangely, it's causing the Rust compiler panics unexpectedly. I'm not sure how to move forwardâ€¦
- Test Curation (Jeena)
    - Haven't started on this yet. As I'm lost about Promise in Fetch, I'll work on this first.
- Response
    - Still fixing things. Currently in git rebase hell.

## Things we learned:
- By doing `let hello = b"hello";`, an [array](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.array.html) is created. An array has a static length. So in our Headers code, we ended up making unnecessary transformations [here](https://github.com/malisas/servo/blob/e631d3a5f6aa251b5694ee56af29009bfb97e4f2/components/script/dom/headers.rs#L113). We wrote `combined_value.push(b","[0]);` which means, "create an array that has length of 1, and whose only element is a comma byte. Then, take the first element of it and add that to `combined_value`. We can improve this line by writing `combined_value.push(b',');`
- [Cargo.toml vs. Cargo.lock](http://doc.crates.io/guide.html#cargotoml-vs-cargolock)

## TODO:
- Promise in Fetch
    - Think about what to do.
- Test Curation
    - Start curating tests!
- Body (Malisa)
    - Start implementing Body for Request and Response
- Miscellaneous
    - Set up blog and write about deref coercion, etc
