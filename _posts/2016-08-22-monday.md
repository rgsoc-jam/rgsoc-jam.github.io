We both enjoyed our long weekends. It featured swimming, the Seattle Opera, a movie triathlon, air conditioning, and Thai food. We feel energized for the second half of RGSoC!

## Things we did:
- Headers (Jeena)
  - After addressing a couple comments, the PR for including "content-type" was approved.
  - It turns out headers list should be sorted before iterating over. Currently figuring out how to sort a hash map. Probably make a vector of the hash map elements and sort the vector.
- Response (Malisa)
  - Implemented more dom::Response methods: `Type`, `Url`, `Redirected`, `Status`, `Ok`, and `StatusText`.

## Things we learned:
  - Was able to use destructuring with `ref` and `&` in a match statement, which helped me understand those concepts a little more. (Malisa)
  - [BTreeMap](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.BTreeMap.html) is a hash map in which the elements can be sorted! (Jeena)

## TODO:
- Headers (Jeena)
    - Figure out how to sort a hash map/iterate through a hash map and create a sorted vector.
- Response (Malisa)
    - Finish up dom::Response functions
    - Read up on the function of the `GlobalRef`
    - figure out what I should do next
