Today is our first day back from Strange Loop...more about that in the next couple days! P.S. It was really cool!

## Things we did:
- Promise in Fetch
    - Opened a [PR](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/13323). This surprisingly took a while because while we were at StrangeLoop, many things happened in the other corners of the Servo codebase!
    - I still have to go through the failing tests and figure out what can be fixed now.
- Test Curation
    - Realized that the web platform tests have been updated! So there are more tests, and more tests are failing. This made the test curation work I did outdated, so this will have to be redone.
- Body
    - Worked on editing my current code in order to get it to a compiling state. Figured out details like function return types, whether or not I need to implement certain spec steps, etc.

## Things we learned:
- [not Servo related] How interpreters work! Malisa and I wrote a simple interpreter in Rust yesterday! Thanks very much to our coach Nick.

## TODO:
- Promise in Fetch
    - Go through failing tests and figure out what I can fix.
- Test Curation (Jeena; lower priority)
    - Go through the new tests, and categorize them.
- Body
    - Get the code to a compiling state. Then figure out if I should get some tests passing and if I should implement more functions (not just `text()`) prior to a PR.
