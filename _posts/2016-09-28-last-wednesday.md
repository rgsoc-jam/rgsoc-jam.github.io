Our [goodbye-blog post](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/blog/2016-09-28-almost-done-jammin) was published on the RGSoC blog! **spoiler**: fetch demo! :O

Also, we had our very last team-wide video call! Boo hoo! Everyone (almost) teared up!

Tonight we're going to [Papers We Love PDX](http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-PDX/) tonight!

## Things we did:
- Body
    - Fixed up [PR](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/13345)......the merge is just around the corner!
- Test Curation
   - There are a lot more web platform tests than before, so I focused on the higher level summary of them.
   - Currently, I finished summarizing most tests except for those in `fetch/api/basic`!!

## TODO:
- Test Curation
    - Finish summarizing!
- Malisa
    - Figure out what to do next! I think I might try to help out with test curation and/or try to understand fetch better.
