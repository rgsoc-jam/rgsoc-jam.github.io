## Things we did:
- After some final changes, the Append method is finally [merged in](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/12467/).
- We found out that our scholarship applications for attending [RustConf](https://tilde.wufoo.com/forms/rustconf-scholarships/) were accepted. We're both really excited to go in September, meet everyone we've met through the Servo community, and learn a lot.
- Continued working on the Request API.
    - Made Body.webidl so that Request can implement Body
    - implemented all readonly attributes, except headers
    - Started working on Constructor
- The Headers append method is merged, but all the other Headers methods still need to be implemented.
    - Started working on the Headers constructor. Discovered a [bug](https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/12527) in the generated UnionTypes.rs file, which we will fix.
- Chatted with our mentor Scott and updated him on our progress, challenges, and goals for the next week.

## Things we learned:
- `git stash` is useful for switching branches on the fly
- Started to learn about [Workers and Windows](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Howto/Write_an_API_reference/Information_contained_in_a_WebIDL_file). This led to a discussion on [processes vs. threads](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/200469/what-is-the-difference-between-a-process-and-a-thread#200473) (which we're still digesting).
- [Rubber Duck Debugging!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)

## TODO:
- Headers:
    - constructor (fix the UnionTypes bug first)
    - introspective methods, such as `get` and `has`
- Request:
    - continue working on constructor. Figure out what's going on with it not finding the union type
