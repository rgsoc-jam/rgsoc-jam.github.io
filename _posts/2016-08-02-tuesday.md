## Things we did:
- Request API
    - Finished writing the constructor.
    - Submitted [PR](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/12700) for the Request API!
- Response API
    - Submitted Fetch spec [bug](https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/348).
    - Worked on the Response API constructor.
- Met with [Stefan](https://twitter.com/datahipster) who showed us some useful tools for looking at Requests/Responses/Headers and also cleared up some questions which had been bugging us.

## Things we learned:
- `dom::bindings::js::MutNullableHeap` allows lazy construction of objects (they can be initialized only when you need them)
- The [`cache-control`](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/http-caching?hl=en) header "directives control who can cache the response, under which conditions, and for how long".
- Also learned about cookies from Stefan. Plus neato command-line tools like `zsh-autosuggestions` and `zsh-syntax-highlighting`. Also [Charles](https://www.charlesproxy.com/support/contact/) for web debugging.
- We asked Stefan about where to find the actual code that makes the HttpRequest to the remote server. The ultimate goal of all this code we're writing is to make an HttpRequest (well, one of the goals), yet the code we're writing seems to dance around that very topic while never actually making the call to the remote server. So this helped clarify things a bit!
    - He pointed us to the call to [`obtain_response`](https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/db808ca75d8645036b4e40d639e2b74b84caf4d2/components/net/fetch/methods.rs#L960) in `methods.rs`.
    - `obtain_response` contains a line [`req.send(request_body)`](https://doc.servo.org/src/net/http_loader.rs.html#806). `req` is a `NetworkHttpRequestFactory` whose `create` method returns a `WrappedHttpRequest`.
    - The `send` function then [calls](https://doc.servo.org/src/net/http_loader.rs.html#311) [`request.start()`](http://doc.servo.org/hyper/client/request/struct.Request.html#method.start), and subsequently [`request_writer.send()`](http://doc.servo.org/hyper/client/request/struct.Request.html#method.send).
    - This in turn calls `hyper::client::response::Response`'s [`with_message`](http://doc.servo.org/hyper/client/response/struct.Response.html#method.with_message) function, which calls `HttpMessage`'s [`get_incoming`](https://doc.servo.org/hyper/http/message/trait.HttpMessage.html#tymethod.get_incoming) function
    - [`get_incoming`](https://doc.servo.org/src/hyper/http/message.rs.html#64) is a trait. Where is its implementation? We don't know....
    - Conclusion: [we need to go deeper!](http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/ab/abdd928ceb8c9e10268b31c3c26be47c2fe1edb8037feae792a1fcc40a05e8ca.jpg)

## TODO:
- Go deeper
- Response:
    - Continue working on constructor.
- Request:
    - Submit a PR to allow tests to run.
    - Address comments once I receive them.
