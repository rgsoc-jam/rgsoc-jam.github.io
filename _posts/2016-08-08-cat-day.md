## Things we did:
- :hatched_chick: Our [blog post](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/blog/2016-08-08-hello-team-jam) is published! :hatched_chick:
- Headers API
    - Simplified Headers constructor and `new` function, and added `fill` function.
    - Started looking into how I should modify WebIDL.py to allow bindings generator to [support default ByteString values](https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/12737).
- Request API
    - (Malisa) Filed spec [bug](https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/358) for request constructor.
    - Finally addressed all the comments from the Request API [PR](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/12700)!

## Things we learned:
**Lifetime Error**

Say you have a one line of code that is:

{% highlight rust %}
let method_string = init_method.clone().to_lower().as_str();
{% endhighlight %}

If you try to compile it, you may get an error that looks like:
![lifetime-error](/img/blog/2016-08-08-lifetime-error.png)
The reason is that `to_lower()` gives back a String, and `as_str()` tries to give a reference to that String created by `to_lower()`. However, that String would not exist anymore because it was consumed by `as_str()` and therefore, the compiler throws an error saying that the borrowed value doesn't live long enough.

To fix this issue, the compiler suggests using `let` binding to increase its life time. In other words, the one line code can be expanded as following:

{% highlight rust %}
let method_lower = init_method.to_lower();
let method_string = method_lower.as_str();
{% endhighlight %}
This way, `as_str()` can return a reference to the String (`method_lower`) which would exist in its scope, i.e. between curly brackets.

Similarly, this won't compile and will throw lifetime errors:

{% highlight rust %}
DOMString::from_string(self.request.borrow().integrity_metadata.borrow().clone())
{% endhighlight %}
Again, it would try to borrow `integrity_metadata` from `self.request` which would be transformed to `Ref<'_, net_traits::request::Request>` after `self.request.borrow()`. This error can be resolved by expanding the code above to this:

{% highlight rust %}
let r = self.request.borrow();
let integrity = r.integrity_metadata.borrow();
DOMString::from_string(integrity.clone())
{% endhighlight %}

## TODO:
- Response:
    - Continue to work on Bindings generator.
    - Work on Constructor.
- Request:
    - Wait for more comments.
- General:
    - Finish up writing blog post, intro to Rust's ownership.
