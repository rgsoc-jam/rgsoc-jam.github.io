It's Malisa's birthday!

## Things we did:
- Request API
    - Worked on [PR](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/12722) and it finally got merged!
    - Continued addressing comments from the Request API [PR](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/12700).
- Response API
    - Finished step 2 of constructor. Learned about character encodings. Progress is slow because I keep having questions about syntax and rust design, etc.
    - Received feedback for an issue I submitted. Submitted 2 additional issues as follow-up: [1](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1292293) and [2](https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/12737).

## Things we learned:
- The below two code snippets are the same:

{% highlight rust %}
match init.mode.as_ref() {
    Some(init_mode) => mode = Some(init_mode.clone().into()),
    None => mode = Some(fallback_mode.unwrap()),
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight rust %}
let mode = init.mode.as_ref().map(|m| m.clone().into()).or(fallback_mode);
{% endhighlight %}

- [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) is limited to only [128 characters](http://www.asciitable.com/), via a 7-bit character set (so, fits in one byte. [UTF-8](http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/utf8.htm) is flexible, on the other hand, and can represent characters that require between 1 and 4 bytes. The first 128 characters are the same for ASCII and UTF-8. UTF standards encode the "code points" as defined in [Unicode](http://stackoverflow.com/a/643810).
    - This is useful for us to know because we are often converting between `ByteString` types, which are basically sequences of 8-bit unsigned integers, and characters or Strings. Many of the [specs](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-1.2) we have to follow reference these encodings. Knowing hexadecimal representation of characters is also useful.

## TODO:
- General:
    - Write a blog post!
- Response:
    - Continue working on constructor.
- Request:
    - Keep addressing comments.
