## Things we did:
- Finished writing test for normalize function, and it passed!
- Started implementing the second step of `Append` method for the Headers API, which is validating name and value of the HTTP headers.

## Things we learned:
- When add a test file to a test package, make sure to update `lib.rs`.

## TODO:
- Learn more Rust (always!)
- Finish implementing validate function (and write tests for it!)
