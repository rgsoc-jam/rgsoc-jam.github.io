## Things we did:
- The Headers API was merged over the weekend. :)
- Response API
    - Spent a lot of the day just get familiar with the webidl and how it should be used. Was mildly successful.
    - Started working on the Response constructor.
- Request API
    - Worked over the weekend to catch up on the hours I missed on Thursday.
    - Wrote constructor up to Step 32 that compiles!

## Things we learned:
- byte-copies in rust involve ["is just shallowly copying an object byte-by-byte, not following pointers"](http://stackoverflow.com/a/24253573), whereas semantic copies involves "duplicating a value to create a new (somewhat) independent instance that can be safely used separately to the old one." Also helpful: [this](http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/27/wrapper-types-in-rust-choosing-your-guarantees/).


## TODO:
- Try to understand how the networking for the Fetch APi works in [methods.rs](https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/master/components/net/fetch/methods.rs).
- Response:
    - Continue working on constructor.
- Request:
    - Continue with constructor! The end is near!!
