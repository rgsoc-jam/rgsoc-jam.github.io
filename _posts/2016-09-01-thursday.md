## Things we did:
- We spent some time looking into how Firefox and Chrome implement Headers . Interestingly, they don't return combined-values when you "get" or "get-all", just an array of values.
- Response
    - Refactored the code to get rid of the internally stored net_traits::Response. It compiles and passes tests.
    - Only thing I'm unsure about is the how to handle `internal_response`, now that there is no longer a net_traits::Response in dom::Response.
- Test Curation
    - Wrote a [more detailed explanation](https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/11894#issuecomment-244184468) about tests
    - This brought up the [comma-space issue](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/13004) again! Spent the afternoon testing Headers API in different browsers and comparing them to the spec.

## Things we learned:
- You can test out the Headers functions for any browser by using the given JS console via the Inspect button! e.g.

`h = new Headers`
> Headers {  }
`h.append("foo", "bar")`
> undefined
`h.get("foo")`
> "bar"

Sweet.

- Not everyone follows the spec word-for-word.

## TODO:
- Body
    - Assuming dom::Response gets merged, start implementing body for Response and Request
- Promise in Fetch
    - Make sure everything I can build as of now is done!
