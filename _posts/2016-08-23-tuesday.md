## Things we did:
- Headers
  - Submitted a [PR](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/12998) about implementing iterable for headers.
  - Submitted a [PR](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/13004) for updating DOM Headers. Making more tests pass is fun!!!

- Response
  - Finished up implementing dom::Response. Now dealing with wpt test errors.

## Things we learned:
- Fetch requests originate in the script thread via a JavaScript function. The request gets sent to the dom objects (e.g. dom::Request) and are sent to the resource thread using [`net_traits::CoreResourceMsg`](https://doc.servo.org/net_traits/enum.CoreResourceMsg.html). The resource thread calls the actual HttpRequest. The response is sent back to the script thread and the original Promise is resolved. Yay! This is just a broad overview...

## TODO:
- Fetch Method (Jeena)
  - Read about `fetch`. Decided to start working on `fetch` (one of jdm's suggestions). He wrote:
  "Start working on the actual `fetch()` API, focusing on the code that deals with the arguments and initiating the request and ignoring the return value for now." At this moment, I won't have to worry about `Promise` because "there's enough work that goes into dealing with the arguments to the function and initiating the request that the promise-related bits can be done separately and subsequently."


- Response
  - Submit the PR once tests pass.
