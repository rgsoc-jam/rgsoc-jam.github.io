## Things we did:
- Wrote our intro blog for the Rails Girls website.
- Headers API
    - Back to the Headers API! Pulling fill method out of constructor and making it its own thing.
- Request API
    - Continued addressing comments from the Request API [PR](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/12700).

## Things we learned:
- Squashing commits is really annoying when you have a merge conflict history. You end up having to resolve them again.
- Practiced dealing with merge conflicts.

## TODO:
- Headers:
    - Finish up changes to constructor/fill method. Push to Jeena's repo.
- Response:
    - Continue working on constructor.
    - Work on bindings generator [issue](https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/12737)
- Request:
    - Keep addressing comments.
