## Things we did:
- Request API
    - Finished Implementing all readonly attributes.
    - Started working on Constructor.

- Headers API
    - Realized that the `hyper::header::Headers` `set_raw()` and `get_raw()` act as though there is only one entry for a given unique header name.
    - Spent much of the day understanding the consequences of this (do we re-write our Headers `append()` method or re-write `hyper::header::Headers`?), piecing together instructions from various specs, and planning the next steps --> Decided to go with the current `hyper::header::Headers` implementation.
    - Currently re-working the `append()` method and other Header API functions.

## Things we learned:
- `if let` is handy if you want to match for only certain cases. For example, following code snippets are the same.
{% highlight rust %}
if let RequestOrUSVString::Request(req) = input {
    // Do stuff
}

match input {
    RequestOrUSVString::Request(req) => // Do stuff,
    RequestOrUSVString::USVString(_) => {},
};
{% endhighlight %}
- Understood `hyper::header::Headers` better.

## TODO:
- Headers:
    - Refine `has`
    - Refine `get`
    - Work on `delete`, `set`, and `iterable`
    - introspective methods, such as `get` and `has`
- Request:
    - Figure out what I can use instead of `clone()`
    - Continue with Constructor
