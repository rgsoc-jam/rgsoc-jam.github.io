## Things we did:
- Request API
    - Figured out how to include Body in the Request API. For now, because we are using only a single Body attribute, it's better to implement that attribute in the Request struct.
    - There are `Request object` and `request`, and they are different! Request object is exposed to JS. `request` that is part of Request object is used internally.
- Headers API
    - Malisa worked on fixing an [issue](https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/12527) that has been blocking her work.
- ByteStrings in Union Types
    - Malisa sent a [pull request](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/12546)!

## Things we learned:
- When checking the enum variant of a variable binding, use `match` (not `if`).
- `match` requires addressing every possible situation, so `_` might be necessary.
- Servo uses Python to generate Rust code! Webidl is parsed by Python to generate Rust binding code, union types, and etc.

## TODO:
- Headers:
    - constructor
    - introspective methods, such as `get` and `has`
- Request:
    - continue writing constructor
    - include `request` in `Request`
